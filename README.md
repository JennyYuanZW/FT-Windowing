# FT-Windowing

Aims and Objectives
1. Understand the purpose of windowing, when it might be needed, and what factors should
be taken into account.
2. Research various different types of window functions and investigate their properties.
3. Comment on how the signal properties affect the choice of window.  What type of
window function would you use for the data collected in the short lab, and why?  What
type of window would you use for actual earthquake data?  (Hint: remember a real
earthquake has quite a sharp increase in amplitude at the beginning.  Some earthquake
data is available in the integrated coursework online resources.)
Then attempt one (or both) of the following tasks:
● Design and conduct an experiment to test the effects of various types of windowing function.
Using generated data (e.g. a sum of sine waves) gives a signal with a known frequency
content, so you know what the desired results are, and can compare each window function
with these.
● Investigate and test the effects of window overlapping.  What
